<h1>Assignment 10: Due before start of class 27 Oct:</h1>
<h3>The goal of this assignment is for you to explore "classic" models from a <i>Stochastic</i> viewpoint.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Read and re-read, then ponder and re-ponder, all of Module 9 from <i>Shiflet&Shiflet</i> (pages 375-414). You should develop a firm grasp of all of the 
topics on page 375 (except for "Loading a file")</li>
<p>
<li>As discussed in class, build or modify an Excel spreadsheet to perform 10 coin flips 10 times, then 100 flips 5 times, and 1000 flips 5 times and 
record your results FOR THE RATIO OF THE NUMBER OF HEADS TO FLIPS (NOT THE NUMBER OF HEADS) IN YOUR NOTEBOOK and in the Coin (Data) Collector sheet linked to on the Course Web page.
<p>
<li>By yourself or with a partner, and using Excel (or google sheets) as your experimental tool, build and compare two "Monte Carlo" computations of PI:
<ul>
<li>by computing the "area under the quarter circle"
<li>by computing the "average value of the quarter circle"
</ul>
<p>
Conduct runs of sufficient design and length to estimate the error in your computation. In your notebook, collect your expectations
and observations, then reflect on what you learned in this exercise about Monte Carlo integration. Come to class ready to share and compare your
solutions. Results should be in your notebook.
<p>
<b><i>For the next two modeling exercises, record your expectations, observations, and reflections in your notebook. 
Come to class prepared to discuss these models in detail.</i></b>
<p>
<li>Google "Rabbits and Wolves" to find the Interactivate model of predator/predator-prey/prey.<p>
<ul>
<li>Run the model with its initial values as given multiple times. How do the runs differ?
<li>Investigate the effect of forest size on keeping all three species co-existing for as long as possible.
<li>Investigate the effect of forest border on keeping all three species co-existing for as long as possible.
<li>Examine and explore the various parameters and think deeply which parameters can one "reasonably vary" through human intervention?
<li>How might you simulate the effects of a drought on the model? Which parameters might be affected?
<li>In what ways is this version of Predator-Prey different from the Vensim version?
</ul>
<p>
<li>Google "Spread of Disease" to find the Interactivate model of S-I-R.
<ul>
<li>Run the model with its initial values as given multiple times. How do the runs differ?
<li>Investigate the effect of grid size on the spread of disease.
<li>Investigate the effect of grid border on the spread of disease.
<li>Examine and explore the various parameters and think deeply which parameters can one "reasonably vary" through human intervention?
<li>In what ways is this version of S-I-R different from the Vensim version?
</ul>
