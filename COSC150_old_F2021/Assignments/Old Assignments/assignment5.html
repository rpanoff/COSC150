<h1>Assignment 5: Assigned 3 March 2017; Due 7 March 2017</h1>
<h3>The goals of this assignment are for you to think about and work with <b><i>analogous systems</i></b> 
to practice turning simple stories into difference equations, and changing difference equations into iterative Euler models.
<ol>
<ul>
<li>Think about the fundamental equation of System Dynamics in the Euler model form:<p>
<center>  HAVE = HAD + CHANGE</center><p>
<li>Download the following assignment: <a href=HW5.pdf>Homework 5 Instructions</a>
<li>Write out all your answers in your notebook. There will be an "open book" rapid-fire quiz at the beginning of class on Tuesday.
</ul>
</ol>
<h2>Use folder hw5 in <a href="https://piazza.com/wofford/spring2017/cosc150/home" target=_blank>Piazza</a> if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.</h2>
