<h1>Assignment 6: Assigned 29 Sep, Due 4 October 2016</h1>
<h3>The goals of this assignment are for you to expect, observe, and reflect on the effects of different kinds of change in a dynamic system,
that is, you will explore HAVE = HAD + CHANGE using Excel as your <i>observatory</i>.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Note: You <i>really</i> need to understand the <i>discussion</i> of various models in Modules 2.2 and 2.3; I would suggest looking over this 
materials before you do the exercises here, and again after.</li>
<p>
<li>Using the <a href="SimplePopulation.xls">Population Model Template</a> introduced in class, do the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>First, make sure you have defined quantities for Time = [0,25] and generate for each of the six cases below:
<ol>
<li>an <b>expectation</b> of what you observe for each defined "change"; write down your expectations for each case (be honest);
<li>a graph showing your <b>observation</b>; sketch the graphs in your notebook;
<li>"add a trendline" with an appropriate shape <i>if you can</i> and write the resulting equation in the notebook (Note: you may also use MultiFunctionDataFlyer for this);
<li>a <b>reflection</b> of the resulting graphs and any variation caused by adjusting any of the parameters; relate the 'shape' of the change to the 'shape" of the resulting behavior.
</ol>


<li>For each of the following "changes", in cell <b>J8</b> <i>replace what is 'inside the parentheses'</i>, with each rate of change <b><i>and then "double click" the lower right corner to copy down</i></b>):
<ul> 
<li> 0
<li> 10
<li> 10*time
<li> b*Ro 
<li> Competition Model: b*Ro - comp*Ro*(Ro-1)/2    <br>(Note: comp is defined and has a controlling scroll bar)
<li> Carrying Capacity Model: b*Ro*(1 - Ro/capacity)   <br>(Note: Introduce a new named cell called "capacity" and use  a scroll bar to vary its value from 100 to 2000 in increments of 50)
</ul>
<li> Compare and contrast what you can learn from comparing and contrasting the Competition Model and Carrying Capacity Model. As an example, for a given birth rate, are there values for <i>comp</i> and <i>capacity</i> which produce the same observable behavior?
</ol>
