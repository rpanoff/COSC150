<h1>Assignment 4: Due 9 pm 26 September 2016</h1>
<h3>The goal of this assignment is for you to explore and discover the power and limits of numerical modeling.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Review your notes from class on features of Excel. In particular you should know how to:</li>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Name a cell as a variable
<li>Name a range of cells as a variable
<li>Introduce a control such as a scroll bar
<li>Then use a scroll bar to assign a non-integer value between two limits
<li>Use an IF statement to test some condition, and set a value if true, and a different value if false.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Demonstrating as appropriate your skills above, construct an Excel file in which you:<p>
<ul>
<li>Find the largest positive integer that Excel can represent as an integer
<li>Find the most negative integer that Excel can represent as an integer
<li>Find the largest floating point number that Excel can represent
<li>Find the most negative floating point number that Excel can represent
<li>Find the smallest positive floating point number that Excel can represent
<li>Find the largest number that, when added to 1, still returns 1
<li>Find the largest number that, when added to Avogadro's Number, still returns Avogadro's Number
<li>Find the largest number that when you take the cosine of that number still returns 1
<li>Find the largest integer for which FACT(N) accurately returns N! (N factorial)
</ul>
<li>In the file, on a separate sheet named "Reflection" discuss what you learned from this assignment.
<li>Name this file so I know it is from you, and e-mail it to me before 9 pm MONDAY 26 September 2016
</ol>
