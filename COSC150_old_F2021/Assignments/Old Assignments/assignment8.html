<h3>The goals of this assignment are for you to download your own copy of Vensim PLE and to build simple models.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Note: On-going: You will benefit by browsing all of Chapters 2, 3, and 4 to appreciate the range of system models in science.</li>
<p>
<li>If you have not done so already, go to <a href=http://vensim.com/free-download/ target=_blank>GET VENSIM PLE</a> and follow instructions to get your own copy of Vensim PLE. If you do not have
