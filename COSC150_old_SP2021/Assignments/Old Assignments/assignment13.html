<h1>Assignment 13: Due before start of class 15 November:</h1>
<h3>The goal of this assignment is for you to continue to explore agent models with AgentCubesOnline</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Be inquisitive and familiarize yourself with the various sections of <i>Shiflet&Shiflet</i> that deal with cellular automata and
	agent-based models. TRY TO EXTRACT the general lessons from the specific examples given. Start to formulate ideas for what would be a research 
	project you would be willing to spend 2+ weeks working on and learning about.
<p>
	<li><a href=assignment13.pdf>Download and follow the instructions to enhance and extend the basic models described.</a>
