<h1>Assignment 11: Due before start of class 8 November (Don't Forget to Vote!):</h1>
<h3>The goal of this assignment is for you to explore diffusion and <i>cellular automata</i></h3>

<ol>
	<li>Read and re-read, then ponder and re-ponder, all of Module 10.1 and 10.2 from <i>Shiflet&Shiflet</i> (pages 417-434). 
<p>
	<li>Based on the exercise in class and applying the discussion in the text, build or modify a single Excel spreadsheet to observe thermal diffusion in a metal bar connected at one
end to a temperature bath held at 99 C. Use two 10x20 grids to represent the bar (10 cells high, 20 cells wide) to compare:
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>using a 4-neighbors algorithm, uniform spread (von Neumann neighborhood)
		<li>using an 8-neighbors algorithm, uniform spread (Moore neighborhood)
	</ol>
	<p>
You will end up wih 2 separate 10x20 grids on the same sheet to run and compare. For both "diffusers", I would recommend defining the diffusion relationship first, then define
the left vertical boundary which should be set to be 99. Use color as a numeral to make the pattern of diffusion clearer.
<ul>
<li>Do you notice any differences in the long-term values of the cells?
<li>Do you notice any differences in the rate of convergence of the cells?
<li>The approach you are using is "Lapace Relaxation with Gauss-Seidel updating".  How would you build your grids to use Jacobi updating?
(I am not asking you to actually build this, but you should know the difference.)
</ul>
</ol>
