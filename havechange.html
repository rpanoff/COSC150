All I knew, this model when it broke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before.
And even though it makes the model slow
Is making time steps smaller for Euler 
In the graph of my model makes it look right

I just wanna model better, model better, model better now
I just wanna model better, model better, model better now

I just wanna model better, model better, model better now
I just wanna model, model, model

'Cause all my models change with time
And Euler uses simple lines
All I know is within a range
Have is Had plus Change
All I know is for integrals
Euler's fine for time steps small
All I know within a range is: 
Have is Had plus Change
